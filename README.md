# In this notebook, I utilize Pyspark to analyze flight delays in 2007 and 2008.
## My goal is to determine
* Which locations (Origin and Dest pairs) had the lowest delays for both arrivals (ArrDelay) and departures (DepDelay) - for each year
* Which locations had fewest amount of delays.
* Did the holidays have an effect on the size of the delays?
* What day of the week has the largest delay lengths?
* If you wanted to ensure you took off at a certain time, what time of day would you pick?
