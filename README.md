# In this notebook, I utilize Pyspark to analyze crime data in Los Angeles from 2020 to 2024.
## My goal is to determine
* The amount of crimes per area
* The amount of crimes committed over time
* Seasonality of crime committed
* Most frequent types of crime committed
* Types of crime committed over time
* Correlation between the area and the type of crime committed
